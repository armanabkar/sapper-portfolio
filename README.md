## üèó Structure

The base structure of this template is the same as Sapper's [default template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template/). These are some of the new things you'll find here:

### src/routes/articles

This is the home of your articles. The most important files in here are:

- `_articles.js`: this module contains the logic for loading and parsing your markdown articles.
- `[slug].svelte`: this is the template of your article page.
- `index.svelte`: this is the template of your article list page.

### src/content/articles

This is where your markdown articles live in. All `.md` files in this directory are treated as articles and parsed automatically by the `_articles.js` module.

- The markdown file name becomes the article slug. For example `hello-world.md` becomes `http://localhost:3000/articles/hello-world`.
- Everything between the start of the article and the `<!-- more -->` tag becomes the article's "excerpt".
- Frontmatter properties supported are `title` and `date`.

### src/routes/projects.svelte

This is your projects page. You can add your projects information to projects array in src/information.js module.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information

You can edit all the personal information and projects in src/information.config.js module.

```js
export const Information = {
  name: "Lorem Ipsum",
  profilePicture: "",
  position: "Lorem Ipsum",
  location: "Lorem, Ipsum",
  about: [
    "Sit ut magna laboris magna.",
  ],
  skills:
    "Lorem, Ipsum",
  interests:
    "Lorem, Ipsum",
  experiences: [
    {
      position: "Lorem Ipsum",
      company: "Lorem Ipsum",
      location: "Lorem, Ipsum",
      date: "Sep 2019 - Present",
    },
  ],
  email: "loremipsum@gmail.com",
  socialMedia: {
    LinkedIn: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/loremipsum/",
